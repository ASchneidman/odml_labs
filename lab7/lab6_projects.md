Lab 7: Group work on projects
===
The goal of this lab is for you to make progess on your project, together as a group. You'll set goals and work towards them, and report what you got done, chaellenges you faced, and subsequent plans.

Group name:
---
Group members present in lab today:
Alex, Navya, Bassam

1: Plan
----
1. What is your plan for today, and this week? 

Today we met with the course staff to discuss our pivot to privacy preserving techniques. This week we plan on continuing to implement some more privacy preserving methods and pin down how we will benchmark these different techniques.

3. How will each group member contribute towards this plan?

Since Bassam has implemented random projections, Alex and Navya will implement additional techniques. Bassam will look into some more complex hashing-specific methods. 

2: Execution
----
1. What have you achieved today / this week? Was this more than you had planned to get done? If so, what do you think worked well?

This week we implemented the random projections method which is what we had planned to accomplish. 

We met with the course staff to discuss our approach and took the following notes.

a. We should explore tradeoffs with different digest sizes in the cryptographic methods. 
b. Metrics to explore: Runtime, Added power consumption, impact to diarization error rate.
c. Explore how downsampling audio impacts power, performance, and collisions
d. Further explain the benefits of cancelable biometrics. 

3. Was there anything you had hoped to achieve, but did not? What happened? How did you work to resolve these challenges?

N/A

5. What were the contributions of each group member towards all of the above?



3: Next steps
----
1. Are you making sufficient progress towards completing your final project? Explain why or why not. If not, please report how you plan to change the scope and/or focus of your project accordingly.
2. Based on your work today / this week, and your answer to (1), what are your group's planned next steps?
3. How will each group member contribute towards those steps?

Lab 2: Benchmarking
===
The goal of this lab is for you to benchmark and compare model inference efficiency on your devices. **You should benchmark 2*N* models or model variants, where *N* is the size of your group (so, two models per person.)** For now, if you don't have appropriate evaluation data in place that's fine; you can provide pretend data to the model for now and just evaluate efficiency.

Ideally, the models you benchmark will be related to and useful for your class project, but at the very least the efficiency metrics should be useful.

Include any code you write to perform this benchmarking in your Canvas submission (either as a link to a folder on github, in a shared drive, zip, etc).

1: Models
----
1. Which models and/or model variants will your group be benchmarking? Please be specific.

We will be using the following audio embedding models: Mockingjay, Tera, HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, Log Mel

This link gave a pretty comprehensive breakdown of the different audio embedding models that are available and how they differ: https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl

Masked Reconstruction
Masked Prediction
Autoregressive Reconstruction
Contrastive Predictive Coding

2. Why did you choose these models?

We chose these models because each represents a popular methods of audio embedding but they all use different methods of computing when training. 


HuBERT outperforms DiscreteBERT

3. For each model, you will measure parameter count, inference latency, and energy use. For latency and energy, you will also be varying a parameter such as input size or batch size. What are your hypotheses for how the models will compare according to these metrics? Do you think latency will track with energy use, and parameter count? Explain.

We think that some of the more lightweight models, or at least those based on conventional methods of audio analysis, such as Log Mel or wav2vec 2.0 will have a lower parameter count, lower latency, and thus lower energy usage when producing the embedding.

2: Parameter count
----
1. Compute the number of parameters in each model. Remember, in Torch you should be able to start with something like this:
   ```
   num_params = sum([np.prod(p.size()) for p in model.parameters()])
   ```
   Report your results in a table.

<!-- Insert image here containing the parameter numbers of our models -->

2. Does this number account for any parameter sharing that might be part of the model you're benchmarking?




3. Any difficulties you encountered here? Why or why not?




3: Latency
----
1. Compute the inference latency of each model. You should do this by timing the forward pass only. For example, using `timeit`:
    ```
    from timeit import default_timer as timer

    start = timer()
    # ...
    end = timer()
    print(end - start) # Time in seconds, e.g. 5.38091952400282
    ```
    Best practice is to not include the first pass in timing, since it may include data loading, caching, etc.* and to report the mean and standard deviation of *k* repetitions. For the purposes of this lab, *k*=10 is reasonable. (If standard deviation is high, you may want to run more repetitions. If it is low, you might be able to get away with fewer repetitions.)
    
    For more information on `timeit` and measuring elapsed time in Python, you may want to refer to [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/how-to-measure-elapsed-time-in-python).





2. Repeat this, varying one of: batch size, input size, other. Plot the results (sorry this isn't a notebook):
   ```
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   plot_fname = "plot.png"
   x = ... # e.g. batch sizes
   y = ... # mean timings
   
   plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
   plt.xlabel('e.g. batch size')
   plt.ylabel('efficiency metric')
   plt.savefig(plot_fname)
   # or plot.show() if you e.g. copy results to laptop
   ```

<!-- Put plot of latencies here -->

4. Any difficulties you encountered here? Why or why not?





4: Energy use
----
1. Compute the energy use of each model. You can use the `powertop` tool on RPi and Jetson (must be run as root):
    ```
    sudo apt install powertop
    ```
    and/or the `jtop` tool on Jetson (see installation instructions [here](https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats/)). 
    
    Follow the same procedure as you used to compute latency, but this time compute energy: (avg) watts * time. You will likely need to sample power a number of times throughout each inference, and average.
    
    By default, `powertop` takes measurements every 20 seconds. You can change it with the `--time` parameter, which specifies number of seconds and allows for non-integer intervals (0.5 for half a second) e.g. to poll every second for 10 seconds and write to 10 csv files:
    ```
    sudo powertop --time=1 --csv=powertop.log --iteration=10
    ```
    Here is a link to the [`powertop` users guide](https://01.org/sites/default/files/page/powertop_users_guide_201412.pdf) [PDF].

5: Discussion
----
1. Analyze the results. Do they support your hypotheses? Why or why not? Did you notice any strange or unexpected behavior? What might be the underlying reasons for that behavior?

5: Extra
----
A few options:
1. Compute FLOPs for each of your models. If you're using Transformer-based models, you might be able to use or modify the [`flops_counter.py`]() script in this directory. If you're using a CNN-based model, then you might be able to use or modify code in [this project](https://github.com/1adrianb/pytorch-estimate-flops) or similar. 
2. Evaluate on different hardware (for example, you might run the same benchmarking on your laptop.) Compare the results to benchmarking on your device(s).
3. Use real evaluation data and compare accuracy vs. efficiency. Describe your experimental setup in detail (e.g. did you control for input size? Batch size? Are you reporting average efficiency across all examples in the dev set?) Which model(s) appear to have the best trade-off? Do these results differ from benchmarking with synthetic data? Why or why not?

----
\* There are exceptions to this rule, where it may be important to include data loading in benchmarking, depending on the specific application and expected use cases. For the purposes of this lab, we want to isolate any data loading from the inference time due to model computation.
